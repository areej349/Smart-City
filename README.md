# Smart-City

***Problem Statement
Cargo ship operations face challenges such as ships getting lost, losing connection, running out of fuel, delays, bad weather, and the risk of sinking. These issues result in financial losses, delays, and safety risks. Using Cumulocity IoT dashboards, this project aims to provide real-time tracking, fuel monitoring, schedule alerts, weather updates, and emergency alerts. This solution ensures safer, more efficient, and timely ship operations, reducing risks and improving overall performance.

***Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop an integrated IoT-based monitoring system using Cumulocity IoT dashboards to enhance the safety, efficiency, and reliability of cargo ship operations. This system will provide real-time location tracking, , fuel level monitoring, schedule adherence alerts, weather condition updates, and emergency alerts to prevent ships from getting lost, running out of fuel, falling behind schedule, or encountering dangerous situations. By implementing this solution, ship operators can make informed decisions to improve operational performance and mitigate risks.
